This repo contains notebooks related to fireworks package(https://ca23-fireworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/fireworks.nbodylib.potentials.html).
It was a part of the computational astrophysics course where we worked on developing the firework package by defining the initializer of the N body, its dynamics and various integrators. We worked on optimising the force calculation using CPU and GPU parallelization. The plot shows the optimization for different functions.
